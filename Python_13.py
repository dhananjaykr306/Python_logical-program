11.Given a sorted integer array and a target, determine if the target exists in the
array in logarithmic time. If a target exists in the array, the procedure should
return the index of it.
Input: nums[] = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9], target = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: Element found at 4th (index 3) position
â€¢ If there are duplicate elements in the array, the procedure may return any index whose element is
equal to the target.
Input: nums[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7], target = 4
